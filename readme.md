# What is this ?

With the release of battlefield 2042, ripple effect studio, added the ability to make custom game modes called "experiences", currently there is no way to share a game mode outside of the game, this project aims to fill that gap.  
This project will replace the current website at https://bfportal.gg/

# Info
project is now in beta testing  
head over to http://vmi656705.contaboserver.net:8000/, and try it out
