### Django Apps

| App      | Description                                                                                                            |

| core     | The app is the heart of "Experience listing" and User profile, all the models used in the Database are defined in this |

### Few key components

- All the "webpages" are in `<app>/<templates>/<app>/` directory, we can use this structure to override the template of other apps that are installed in python
- The models for all "pages" type are defined in [`/core/models/*`](/bfportal/core/models)
- The API at (https://api.bfportal.gg/) is defined and controlled by [`/core/api/*`](/bfportal/core/api)
- Form validation and discord hooks are done in [`/core/views.py`](/bfportal/core/views.py)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

### Setup

- Create a Python Virtual Environment and activate it
  ```
  py -m venv ./python-venvs/bfportal
  ./python-venvs/bfportal/Scripts/activate
  ```
- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management
  ```
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
