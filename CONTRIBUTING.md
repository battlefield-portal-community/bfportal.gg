If you already have experience with django/wagtail, understanding the backend will be really easy for you.
> **Note**
> If you are just starting it is highly recommended to learn about the structure of a [django project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/). and [wagtail project](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html)

> Learn wagtail first :)
