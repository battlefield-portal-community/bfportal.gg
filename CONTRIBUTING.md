If you already have experience with django/wagtail, understanding the backend will be really easy for you. 
> **Note**  
> 
> If you are just starting it is highly recommended to learn about the structure of a [django project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/). and [wagtail project](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html)

> Learn wagtail first :)

The backend is made up of Four django Apps.

```
bfportal/
    bfportal (Global App)
    core (Content Server)
    factory (Fake data generation)
    theme (tailwind manager)
```

# Django Apps
|App|Description|
|----|----|
|bfportal|This app Contains the base settings and base html file that is used to generate any webpage on the website|

|factory|Is an app that is used to generate fake data to help while developing the project locally|

# Few key components
- All the "webpages" are in `<app>/<templates>/<app>/` directory, we can use this structure to override the template of other apps that are installed in python
- The models for all "pages" type are defined in [`/core/models/*`](/bfportal/core/models)
- The API at (https://api.bfportal.gg/) is defined and controlled by [`/core/api.py`](/bfportal/core/api.py)
- Form validation and discord hooks are done in [`/core/views.py`](/bfportal/core/views.py)
