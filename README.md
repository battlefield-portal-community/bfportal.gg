[![Docker Build](https://github.com/battlefield-portal-community/bfportal.gg/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/battlefield-portal-community/bfportal.gg/actions/workflows/main.yml)

# What is this ?

With the release of battlefield 2042, ripple effect studio, added the ability to make custom game modes called "experiences", currently there is no way to share a game mode outside of the game, this project aims to fill that gap.

# Info

Head over to [bfportal.gg](https://bfportal.gg/), and try it out

## Features

- User system (Discord login for integration with portal community discord server)
- Auto Fill API for forms
- Pagination and website wide search

## How it works

It is pretty straight forward

- You use your discord account to make a new account on the website and submit your experiences.
- On the submission page if u choose to share the playground Url of the experience, the submission form will autofill 😃.

You can later edit your experience if u like.
