# What is this ?

With the release of battlefield 2042, ripple effect studio, added the ability to make custom game modes called "experiences", currently there is no way to share a game mode outside of the game, this project aims to fill that gap.

# Info

## Features

- User system (Discord login for integration with portal community discord server)
